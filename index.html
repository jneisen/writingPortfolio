    <h3>Why Music, Why Now?</h3>
    <p>
    	Windows down, hair blowing back, music playing through the speakers. A twinge of loss, like this moment might never come again. Dead tired, but it was worth it, a night well spent, with people that you love. The laughter, the feeling, the beauty of the nothingness of all of those moments are what you remember, and mourn, as the Noah Kahan plays. You are still with someone you love, but you have settled into a comfortable silence of contentment. The world blurry and dark around you as you hurl through the lights. Throughout all of it, music, tying your feelings perfectly into a little bow. You might never have another night exactly like that, but it was catharsis, one of the rare moments where you feel completely alive. And still the music plays. You never learned the words to this song, in fact you hear the wrong words every time, but it doesn’t matter, you don’t really hear them, adrift in your own little world of feeling.

	I love listening to music in other people’s cars because of that tying togetherness, the music emotes what I cannot, it lets me sit there, content after living my life. I don’t want to choose the music, each different type of music to me represents a different person, a different kindred spirit that I choose to spend some of my life with. Folk is my sibling, Rock is my girlfriend, Alternative is my mother, Rap is one of my best friends, strange Electronic is my other best friend. Not every time I am listening to the car’s music is as perfect and beautiful, but the music serves many purposes in different scenarios, here acting as a reminder of who I am spending my time with.
    </p>

	Sometimes all music does is fill the void. Takes the silence and the whoosh of other cars and turns it into something that is more pleasant to listen to. I am really bad at talking constantly, I seem to reach the limit of what I have to say to people I see often very soon, but music takes that weakness and makes it less impactful, it fills the space that I cannot. Music also can fill the void in a different way, take an exhausting day, and make you feel something at the very least; sadness, happiness, madness, just anything. It can fill emotional voids left by people leaving too early, whether from death or choice. It can even fill the voids within us, when we know that we are not being enough for the people around us, or when we feel as though we are not enough for ourselves. Music is a putty, patching up the mistakes that you made, the wounds that you carry with you.

	Music also is an amazing tool for connection, spanning cultures and years, making us feel as if we are truly similar to the people around us. People identify with liking certain music, and it gives them something to talk about and relate to each other with. Connections are formed and grown through music taste, fan clubs formed and then kept even after an artist stops being good. Often a question to get to know someone better is “What music do you like” because it is a question that can easily form a connection, leading to a friendship. Once I attended a concert for the band Chicago, and I found myself talking to someone next to me who had been listening to them for 50 years, seeing them throughout his years. Playing and making music especially leads to connection, as you talk, and toil with similar people as yourself, who work away at their instruments, just trying to get a little bit better every day, loving music enough to dedicate a big part of their lives to sharing it with others. It leads to a shared struggle in members of a band, as they try to create something wonderful and new.

	Music is instructional as well, giving people a template for how to act or how to not act, spreading wisdom on everyday activities that normally go unspoken. How do you love somebody? How are you supposed to party? And many other entirely important questions that are extremely accessible to people because so many songs have been made about them. Music is acting as a mentor, telling or showing people how they might want to live their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
	One final reason why you might listen to music is because it is awesome. You can find a sound that you love so much that it becomes the song that you listen to for many years to come, and it doesn’t have to come from a place of feeling. You can just enjoy the song so much that you want to listen to it nearly all the time. There needn’t be a reason to put on the radio or a spotify playlist, sometimes that is just what you want to do and you don’t need to look much farther.

	Music creates an incredible atmosphere that is great to simply exist in sometimes. It takes a sequence of notes and gets it stuck in your head. It bottles up a feeling and allows you to experience it later. It connects people across widely different backgrounds, cultures, and lives. Music can help us figure out how we want to live our lives, and it can make you dance. It can make you feel more complete, or tie a moment together in your head. It can make you remember, even when you want to forget. Music is a superpower that represents most importantly people coming together to create. Before music was recorded, every instance of it was people immediately in front of you choosing to spend their time playing you a piece. While music may evolve even further from its roots, it is all about collaboration, people coming together for some greater cause.
    </p>
    <p>
	I love music for all of the substance that it provides, the many atmospheres that it enhances, the collaboration it requires, but most of all I love the meaning that it carries behind it. Whenever I make or listen to music, I am reminded, on some level, of the togetherness and beauty that other people choose to share with me. I am reminded that life is complicated and meaningful and difficult. I am reminded that there are perspectives that I will never understand and abilities I will never reach. In essence, I am reminded of humanity.
