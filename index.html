    <h3>Why Music, Why Now?</h3>
    <p>
    	Windows down, hair blowing back, music playing through the speakers. A twinge of loss, like this moment might never come again. Dead tired, but it was worth it, a night well spent, with people that you love. The laughter, the feeling, the beauty of the nothingness of all of those moments are what you remember, and mourn, as the Noah Kahan plays. You are still with someone you love, but you have settled into a comfortable silence of contentment. The world blurry and dark around you as you hurl through the lights. Throughout all of it, music, tying your feelings perfectly into a little bow. You might never have another night exactly like that, but it was catharsis, one of the rare moments where you feel completely alive. And still the music plays. You never learned the words to this song, in fact you hear the wrong words every time, but it doesn’t matter, you don’t really hear them, adrift in your own little world of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
	I love listening to music in other people’s cars because of that tying togetherness, the music emotes what I cannot, it lets me sit there, content after living my life. I don’t want to choose the music, each different type of music to me represents a different person, a different kindred spirit that I choose to spend some of my life with. Folk is my sibling, Rock is my girlfriend, Alternative is my mother, Rap is one of my best friends, strange Electronic is my other best friend. Not every time I am listening to the car’s music is as perfect and beautiful, but the music serves many purposes in different scenarios, here acting as a reminder of who I am spending my time with.
    </p>
    <p>
	Sometimes all music does is fill the void. Takes the silence and the whoosh of other cars and turns it into something that is more pleasant to listen to. I am really bad at talking constantly, I seem to reach the limit of what I have to say to people I see often very soon, but music takes that weakness and makes it less impactful, it fills the space that I cannot. Music also can fill the void in a different way, take an exhausting day, and make you feel something at the very least; sadness, happiness, madness, just anything. It can fill emotional voids left by people leaving too early, whether from death or choice. It can even fill the voids within us, when we know that we are not being enough for the people around us, or when we feel as though we are not enough for ourselves. Music is a putty, patching up the mistakes that you made, the wounds that you carry with you. 
    </p>
    <p>
	Music also is an amazing tool for connection, spanning cultures and years, making us feel as if we are truly similar to the people around us. People identify with liking certain music, and it gives them something to talk about and relate to each other with. Connections are formed and grown through music taste, fan clubs formed and then kept even after an artist stops being good. Often a question to get to know someone better is “What music do you like” because it is a question that can easily form a connection, leading to a friendship. Once I attended a concert for the band Chicago, and I found myself talking to someone next to me who had been listening to them for 50 years, seeing them throughout his years. Playing and making music especially leads to connection, as you talk, and toil with similar people as yourself, who work away at their instruments, just trying to get a little bit better every day, loving music enough to dedicate a big part of their lives to sharing it with others. It leads to a shared struggle in members of a band, as they try to create something wonderful and new.
    </p>
    <p>
	Music is instructional as well, giving people a template for how to act or how to not act, spreading wisdom on everyday activities that normally go unspoken. How do you love somebody? How are you supposed to party? And many other entirely important questions that are extremely accessible to people because so many songs have been made about them. Music is acting as a mentor, telling or showing people how they might want to live their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
	One final reason why you might listen to music is because it is awesome. You can find a sound that you love so much that it becomes the song that you listen to for many years to come, and it doesn’t have to come from a place of feeling. You can just enjoy the song so much that you want to listen to it nearly all the time. There needn’t be a reason to put on the radio or a spotify playlist, sometimes that is just what you want to do and you don’t need to look much farther. 
    </p>
    <p>
	Music creates an incredible atmosphere that is great to simply exist in sometimes. It takes a sequence of notes and gets it stuck in your head. It bottles up a feeling and allows you to experience it later. It connects people across widely different backgrounds, cultures, and lives. Music can help us figure out how we want to live our lives, and it can make you dance. It can make you feel more complete, or tie a moment together in your head. It can make you remember, even when you want to forget. Music is a superpower that represents most importantly people coming together to create. Before music was recorded, every instance of it was people immediately in front of you choosing to spend their time playing you a piece. While music may evolve even further from its roots, it is all about collaboration, people coming together for some greater cause.
    </p>
    <p>
	I love music for all of the substance that it provides, the many atmospheres that it enhances, the collaboration it requires, but most of all I love the meaning that it carries behind it. Whenever I make or listen to music, I am reminded, on some level, of the togetherness and beauty that other people choose to share with me. I am reminded that life is complicated and meaningful and difficult. I am reminded that there are perspectives that I will never understand and abilities I will never reach. In essence, I am reminded of humanity.

    <h3>An Odd Color of Greene</h3>
    <p>
    The novel All-Bright Court is a book about a community within a dilapidated, freshly painted, tenement house in the steel town of Lackawanna, New York, from the 1950’s to the 1970’s. The novel mainly focuses on one family, the Taylors, and especially their eldest son, Mikey. The novel explores what life was like for poor black people during the 50’s, moving North to work factory jobs and developing lifelong illnesses and injuries from the hard labor and terrible conditions, as Mikey’s father Samuel does. It explores the Taylor’s hope for their children’s futures, letting Mikey attend a PWI for gifted kids in nearby town Essex. The novel places direct emphasis on the internal conflict within Mikey between his racial identity and wanting to be white, for all the power that comes with it. In the tenement, early in the novel, a minor character by the name of Greene shows up, with 6 kids in tow. Greene largely does not affect Mikey, except in the end of the novel where she refuses to take her albino granddaughter in, leaving one of Mikey’s mother’s friends to take care of Greene’s granddaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
Despite her limited presence in the novel, Greene is a really interesting character mainly because she is shunned by the community. She is shunned for being a sex worker, but the community instead of berating her for her work, call her a conjure woman as if it is an evil identity and blame their hate on her “not leaving her country ways behind.” The residents take a really interesting and deep belief with hoodoo and vilify it, citing hoodoo as the reason for floods, droughts, curses, and miscarriages. And while the hoodoo religion does include within its belief set ways of cursing others, the tenants completely ignore the protection and healing that hoodooism promises to bring. They then pin this negative view of hoodooism to Greene because of the practices that align with hoodooism that she does do, i.e.  making her children wear asafetida bags. Asafetida bags represent a way to prevent illness that came to America with the Atlantic Slave Trade, that is closely linked with hoodooism/rootwork, “the spiritual tradition known as rootwork pivoted on the use of asafetida for its presumed magical properties… to provide charms and spells, cure afflictions, and solve problems,” (Sumner, 100).
    </p>
    <p>
I believe that Greene is a conjure woman despite her insistence to her daughter-in-law Zena to the contrary and the belief that she is a conjure woman, coming from tenants in the book “believ[ing] what they want to,” (Porter, 136). With her traditional asafetida bags, looking at her son Karo’s eyelids while he sleeps to know that he loves Zena, and wanting a dead bat when they run through town, the evidence points toward her being a conjure woman. Still the characters in the book unfairly blame her for many events, of which she seems to have no connection, such as the two chickens disappearing from Jesus’ family’s yard, the sewers backing up, and illnesses such as ringworm in other people’s children.
    </p>
    <p>
	While it is not entirely clear cut, I believe that Greene must also be a sex worker, coming from the tantalizing language that the novel uses when describing husbands coming and going from her back door. “Explor[ing] the riches of her mouth,” (Porter, 49). Along with the stated fact that “Greene had no trouble attracting men,” (Porter, 49). Also supporting this idea is her lack of stated source of income, meanwhile she supports at least 6 children.
    </p>
    <p>
	To the characters of All-Bright Court, her dual occupations represent a perfect union of tabooness. People, even nowadays, rarely talk about being in sex-work, so they certainly weren’t talking about it back then. The people who live at All-Bright Court are also trying to escape the South in every way possible, including by rejecting the hoodoo culture almost entirely. While she represents this perfect taboo, people still discretely go to her for both sex work and probably her hoodoo work. Seen by the husbands going in and out of her back door and Venita’s serious consideration of talking to her about her fertility when she is desperate. She is hated in the community for being a crutch for its members, but I would argue that she is also needed in the community. Sex workers exist because there is a need for their services, if the husbands of All-Bright Court are unfaithful enough to their wives to cheat on them, then a sex worker is a good discretionary person to turn to. The tenants also need spiritual guidance, they need the kind of hope that faith (including hoodoo) provides. Greene should not be hated for the services she provides to the community, but because those services remind the community of their weaknesses and insecurities, she is.
    </p>
    <p>
	Greene in the novel is a source of bizarre events, but she is not a force of evil. People blame her for causing evil events, but there is no proof that she does anything nefarious. When Samuel enters her house near the end of the novel, he remarks to himself about the ordinariness of the place, “This could be his house,” (Porter, 152). She is just a single mother, purportedly struggling to put food on her table, shown with her refusal to take Clotel (another mouth to feed) with a deep underlying sadness in her voice. We see her coping with what life has thrown at her in the same scene where Samuel sees her house, where she takes a pinch of something (presumably some form of snuff) from a rusty red tin and tucks it under her lip, later stating apologetically to Samuel, after rejecting Clotel, “All a body can do is what it can,” (Porter, 152).
    </p>
    <p>
	Emphasizing Greene’s distance from the community is her relationship with Zena, her daughter in law. They seemingly never talked, even while Karo and Zena were dating, with Greene pretending like Zena was just a passing wind, as if she did not exist. I think this interaction comes from Zena avoiding Greene because of her mothers warnings, and Greene adapting her feelings to be okay with not talking to her daughter in law.
    </p>
    <p>
	Greene in All-Bright Court is a microcosm of the housing development itself. She is both needed to keep society running, while also being looked down upon, much like the tenants who create the steel to keep the USA’s industry running, but live in a rejected and run down building. She works incredibly hard, shown by her supporting 6 children as a single mother, the same type of tenacity that all of the tenants in All-Bright Court display in order to survive. She is incredibly imperfect, shown by her relationships with the people in All-Bright Court, her silence with Zena and the main characters never saying anything positive about her, just like the housing development itself, built to exploit people, but still acting as many a person’s home. She shows a recursive element of society. People seem to always look down on someone that they see worse than them, even when they are not doing very well themselves. For Mikey, she means that he will never fit in with the white society he so desperately wants to be a part of. She means that he will continue to struggle with looking down on his family and those with fewer opportunities than him. She represents the internal battle within him, straddling the line of identity and opportunity, past and future.

    <h3>A New Degree: Turning up the Heat in College</h3>
    <p>
	Toni Cade Bambara, in her essay Realizing the Dream of a Black University, remarks about the strides that the students of the 60’s must make in order to “obtain a relevant, real education.” To do this she proposes a complete reform of the education at university, stemming from the inapplicability of the education that students were receiving: what is the use of economics if it does not reflect the real situation that students will be subject to. She proposes a Center of Black and Hispanic Studies that emphasizes (and creates) courses with complete and valuable ideas, researches new knowledge into the black experience, and provides useful skills for learning and growing as people. Bambara emphasizes a student-led movement to push for the center with the logic being that any panacea that comes from the top will be suspect, and that any reforms that are made top-down will not help the underlying issues.
    </p>
    <p>
	A similar issue is facing colleges broadly today: an issue of direction and limitation within the university, which is preventing it from being as useful and valuable as it could be. Specifically there exists a rift between the idea of a university being a place where one can learn whatever they fancy or require for themself and the current iteration of a university.
    </p>
    <p>
	The most important resource that a university can offer in terms of an education is quality professors, and universities broadly are currently not cutting it. There needs to be a reform in terms of the selection and renewal of professorships in the university to ensure both a greater average quality and especially a far better minimum level of aptitude. Certain professors in this day and age seem not to care about student success or imparting as much material and knowledge to their students as possible and instead elect to seemingly make the course as arbitrarily difficult or esoteric as they can. This certainly does not need to be the case, and I think that it could be remedied by a few reforms involving selecting professors:
    </p>
<style>
p{
	text-indent = 0px;
}
</style>
    <p>
1) Professors should NOT be selected entirely based on their academic credentials; professors need to be able to teach effectively while having a significant knowledge base and passion for the topic. The selection of a professor should more holistically look at their ability to teach, not just what they know.
    </p>
    <p>
2) There needs to be some standard introduced that rates the professors on a consistent time scale that assures that the quality of their teaching and relevance does not decline. These standards should not be completely based on student rating (because hard classes will be unfairly ranked despite the necessary struggle), but instead by an auditor who actually has to complete an amount of the course.
    </p>
    <p>
3) There should be more opportunities for professors to grow as teachers and people in a university position in order to improve their abilities during their tenure at the university, rather than let them decline. This is primarily to make the higher standards far more possible to reach.
    </p>
<style>
p{
	text-indent: 50px;
}
</style>
    <p>
    Involving keeping the university experience more tailored to each student is a commitment that the university must make to keep the curriculum more open, fluid, and more broadly applicable. Meaning that the university should first change its major requirements to be far looser in terms of classes, specifically streamlining the current classes that are currently part of each major’s core into fewer. Each major should still be accredited and invoke a level of rigor and ability, but the fat should be trimmed. Secondly, the university has to allow students to take more classes, fewer classes should be locked behind major requirements, and prerequisites should have to be absolutely necessary to understand the course rather than just a rigor check. This loosening of the major requirements, combined with the new ability to register for more classes should allow students to take more classes that they would like to take within the university, increasing individual choice and value gained from the university.
    </p>
    <p>
	The classes that the university also offers should be changed fundamentally to reflect more of the world that students will be entering afterward: namely they should be more project based and open ended. Currently a majority of the classes at the university follow a similar structure of a grade being broken up into any combination of homework, attendance, quizzes, tests, and finals, but I think that this system is far too rigid. Not to mention, when projects are assigned in class, they often railroad the student into specific solutions and do not require much creativity to solve. I propose that the university encourage instructors to create more engaging courses by requiring, for some classes, a number of open-ended, group projects. I believe that this would increase the value of the university’s education because it would allow students to flex their creative muscles and also reflects a more similar environment to the current workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
	With this new and more fluid university, someone should be there to help the students make sense of their schedule and all of the opportunities and services the university offers: the advisor. A rare few advisors do a good job currently at helping students make the correct decisions for them, but this needs to be the rule rather than the exception within the university. Advisors should not only be able to help the student solve technical issues and resolve scheduling conflicts, but they should be required to meet with each student (unless the student opts out) in order to determine their current plan for university, every single semester. This does not only include advising on which classes are required to take for a specific major or minor, but should also include non-major requirements: interesting classes, stellar professors, clubs that it seems like the student would be interested in, and opportunities that the student should take (such as on campus activities). An advisor should need to be in tune with the university and be able to guide the student toward making their college experience what they would like it to be, not just simply a way for a student to override into classes.
    </p>
    <p>
	A good question to ask regarding these reforms is: why haven’t they been done already? They are fairly simple reforms regarding the university, and, at least to me, they make a lot of sense. The answer is simple: the administration does not need these changes to continue to make money. A great theme among large institutions and bureaucracy is the trite saying “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” and while I believe that the changes that I outlined here would bring great long term success (at least in terms of greater student satisfaction), to get there would involve a wildly uncomfortable few years for the university. If they implement a way to audit and judge professor performance, that leads to meaningful consequences, even if they give ample warning to the professors, that will mean firing and hiring not an insignificant portion of professors.  It will involve creating new resources for teaching that don’t already exist. Both of which will cost time and money. If the university requires advisors to do significantly more work, they would also have to acknowledge that they need a lot more advisors, and would therefore need to spend a significant amount of money to hire them, not even counting the training they would have to implement to make sure the advisors are effective. The reformation of majors would create an awkward spot for the next few years as you have students that are required to take different classes within the same major, as well as costing money in terms of hiring people to determine what parts of each major are actually essential to accreditation. By opening up the curriculum, you might face backlash from professors who think that only higher level students should be able to be in their class and students that struggle because they did not understand the rigor they were subjecting themselves to. The only way to make a university swallow the bitter pill of reform, is to make it more uncomfortable for them to exist in a situation without these changes.
    </p>
    <p>
	The time is now for reformation of the university, and much like Bambara says, the calls for change should come from the bottom. Students should be entirely invested in and a part of the university’s future, and they should call for a university that more closely represents the open institution of learning and support that lives inside many children’s imaginations. They should demand change and reform, because that is the only way that it will happen. College might be what you make it, but the institutions and administration at that college should better support you to make it yours.
